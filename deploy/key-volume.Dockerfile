# The key-volume job (deploy/compose.yml service `keys`): compactc 0.34.0, the pinned Passport
# sources, and the relay's dependencies (for the Signet Compact module and the verification's
# ledger-v9). It builds the relay's prover and verifier keys INTO A VOLUME at run time
# (deploy/key-volume/build.sh); the image itself carries no keys.
# Build from the repository root, with the vendor/passport submodule checked out:
#   docker build -f deploy/key-volume.Dockerfile .
