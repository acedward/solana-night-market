# Proof times and DUST per action

Measured on Midnight stagenet (node `2.0.0-d9729c13`, ledger 9 rc.3) and Ethereum Sepolia in
September 2026, with the relay's pinned proof server `midnightntwrk/proof-server:9.0.0-rc.6` and a
sponsor fee margin of 20 (Q19). Local figures come from the ledger-9 stack of the development
recipe. Times depend on the proof server's host, the chain and, for the bridge, on Sig Network's MPC
and Sepolia finality.

## How to read the table

- **Proof** is the time to prove the one circuit the customer signs, as the relay measured it. A
  k=18 circuit needs about 8 GB of RAM on the proof server, and the relay proves one circuit at a
  time. The figures predate the relay-memory fix, which cut a k=18 proof's round trip by about a
  third on the test host (below).
- **Click to done** runs from the customer's signature to the page showing the result.
- **Fees** are what the chain charges, as the indexer reports them. **Sponsor spend** is how far the
  sponsor wallet's DUST balance fell. At margin 20 the wallet declares the fee × 1.046^20 (about
  2.46×), and the whole declared amount leaves the wallet.
- The bank pays every DUST fee except a take's, which the exchange's batcher pays.

## Per action

| Action | Circuits proven | Proof | Click to done | Fees (DUST) | Sponsor spend (DUST) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Open an account | two deploy transactions (verifier keys only), then `activate_initial_device_with_evm` (k=16) | about 6.4 s for the activation (local) | 67.5 s, 78.6 s and 79.9 s on stagenet; 67.1 s local | 24.39 (13.21 + 10.89 + 0.29) | 59.9–60.3 |
| Send from the account (a shielded withdrawal) | `withdraw_shielded_with_evm` (k=18) | about 60 s including the submission (local) | about 60 s (local) | 0.44 (local) | about 1.1 |
| Record a change coin in the inbox (Q13) | `append_inbox_with_evm` (k=18) | about 66 s including the submission (local) | about 66 s (local) | 0.10 on stagenet, 0.40 local | about 0.25 |
| Deposit, Sepolia to Midnight | start: `bridge_deposit_start_with_evm` (calls the vault's `startDeposit` and the singleton's `signBidirectional`); settle: `bridge_deposit_complete` (calls `completeDeposit`) | 67–74 s for the start | 21.5 and 21.8 min | 0.91 start + 0.14 settle | 2.49–2.50 |
| Withdraw, Midnight to Sepolia | start: `bridge_withdraw_start_with_evm` (calls `startWithdraw` and `signBidirectional`); settle: `bridge_withdraw_complete` or `bridge_withdraw_refund` | 66–77 s for the start | 18.2–20.7 min | 1.01–1.14 start + 0.11 settle | 2.63 (whole coin); 3.10 for a partial one with its change recorded |
| Make an offer | `open_swap_shielded_with_evm` (k=18), fully guaranteed | one proof, as for a take | 77 s until the exchange lists it | none until someone takes it | 0 |
| Take an offer | `open_swap_shielded_with_evm` (k=18), fully guaranteed, merged with the maker's offer | 46.2 s | 74 s and 97 s until settled | 0.28–0.30, paid by the batcher | 0 |
| Close a stale request (Q21 A) | a withdrawal's settle as above, or the vault's `abandonDeposit` (k=15) | not measured on stagenet | the relayer loop's remaining wait, then one proof | as the settle it runs | one settle; capped per day (see below) |

## Bridge waits

Most of a transfer's time is spent waiting outside Midnight:

| Stage | Deposit | Withdrawal |
|---|---|---|
| Sig Network signs the Sepolia transaction | 53–109 s after the start | 36–110 s |
| The transaction is broadcast | 59–117 s | 42–126 s |
| Sepolia finality | 945–1,101 s | 850–1,168 s |
| The MPC attests | 1,066–1,171 s | 989–1,255 s |

The bridge gate counted from the start transaction's block, and the bridge lane from the start of
the relay's loop, so the lower ends of the first two rows are the lane's. The relay waits up to 20
minutes for the signature, and up to 33 minutes after the broadcast for the attestation.

Each withdrawal's Sepolia gas is paid by the vault's own EVM account, not by the sponsor. A transfer
cost that account 0.000067–0.000126 ETH, and a withdrawal needs 0.001 ETH available when it starts
(100,000 gas × 10 gwei).

## Stale requests

The relay closes bridge requests whose owners left them open (Q21 A; `relay/src/bridge/stale.ts`).
Each close is one transaction paid by the sponsor: a withdrawal's settle, or the vault's
`abandonDeposit`. Reading the vault and running the relayer loop cost no DUST.

The closer is bounded in three ways:

- by default at most 24 closes are paid for in any 24 hours;
- it pays for nothing while the sponsor holds less than twice the level at which the relay refuses
  customers' actions;
- it runs one close at a time.

`/health` reports the count, the cap and the most recent closes under `bridge.staleRequests`.

## Relay memory during a proof

The relay sends each proof's prover key to the proof server; a k=18 account key is 544 MB. Up to
master `f8710eb` it did that through midnight-js's HTTP proof provider, which held about eight copies
of the key per proof:

- `check` read the key only to send its ZKIR;
- `prove` read it again, and the ledger's WASM built the request body in its own heap, which grew to
  about 1.7 GB and never shrank;
- the ledger's `lookupKey` call copied the key into that heap once more;
- the body was then copied again on its way out.

In the live acceptance run the relay went past its 4 GiB limit during every proof (4.25 GB in memory
plus up to 2.44 GB swapped out; plan question Q25).

Since plan P5.1b (`relay/src/prover/proving-provider.ts`), `check` reads only the ZKIR, `lookupKey`
leaves the prover key out, and `prove` streams the body from the key file in 16 MB chunks. The body
is byte-identical to the one the ledger builds, compared by SHA-256 for the real key, so the proof
server receives the same request and returns the same proof.

Measured with `relay/src/tools/prover-memory.ts` (`test/memory/README.md`):

- **Setup**: `account/append_inbox_with_evm` (k=18), proved through the relay's proof provider against
  `proof-server:9.0.0-rc.6`, on Bun 1.3.11, in a container without swap.
- **What is counted**: the relay process's anonymous memory, sampled every 100 ms.
- **Not counted**: the harness holds no sponsor wallet. An idle relay with a synced wallet adds about
  1 to 1.2 GB to every figure below.

| | Before (measured on `a0b760b`) | After (P5.1b) |
|---|---|---|
| Before any proof | 242 MB | 231 to 246 MB |
| Peak during one proof | **4,604 MB** | **374 MB** |
| 5 s after one proof | 2,953 MB | 226 MB |
| Peaks, four proofs in a row | 4,601 / 4,578 / 5,110 / 5,110 MB | 351 / 329 / 306 / 290 MB |
| After four proofs | 3,475 MB, and 1,843 MB after a forced GC | 175 MB |
| One proof's round trip on the test host | 30.5 to 31.4 s | 19.1 to 19.5 s |
| Four proofs in a 1 GiB container without swap | killed by the kernel during the first | pass, peak 339 MB |

A forced `Bun.gc(true)` after each proof freed nothing on the old path, and the new path does not
need it. A bridge start proves three calls at once (the account's, the vault's and the Signet
singleton's). Each call streams its own key, so the relay holds a few 16 MB chunks, not three keys.

## Sources

The figures come from the project's evidence: the account lane's local and live registration, the
bridge gate and the bridge lane's live runs through the UI, the trading lane's live take and
make/take through the UI, the stack recipe's activation proof, the live acceptance run (relay
memory before the fix) and the relay-memory measurements of plan P5.1b.
