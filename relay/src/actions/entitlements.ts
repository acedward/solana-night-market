// Sponsored inbox appends (security review F-B3).
//
// `append-inbox` files a 192-byte entry sealed to the account's own key: the market cannot read it,
// so it cannot tell a real change coin from junk. It therefore sponsors an append ONLY against a
// single-use ENTITLEMENT it issued itself, when it ran an operation that left a coin of the account
// without a correct inbox entry:
//   - a withdrawal to a wallet with change (the arm's `withdraw_shielded` files no entry for it).
//
// The relay keeps no per-customer record (Q5, FR-003). The entitlement is a token the browser keeps
// with the coin: `ae1.<account>.<op>.<expiry>.<mac>`, where `op` identifies the operation (a hash of
// its kind and transaction id) and `mac` is HMAC-SHA256 over the network, account, op and expiry
// with a key derived from the sponsor seed, so tokens survive a relay restart and cannot be forged.
//
// Single use: an admitted token's op is held while its job runs, marked spent when the append
// succeeds, and released when it fails (so the customer can retry). Spent ops are remembered in
// memory until their token expires. A restart forgets them, so a per-account daily budget of
// QUEUED appends is the backstop. The budget counts an append once it is queued (an attempted
// execution: its job may prove and pay before it fails, so a failed job keeps its charge). A
// request the route refuses after admission (a full queue) queued nothing, and its admission's
// `release` gives back both the entitlement and the charge (security review F-B7).
