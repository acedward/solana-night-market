// The relay-assisted take (questions file Q15, option A): the fallback when a Passport account
// cannot take an offer in one atomic transaction. One signature, several transactions, NOT atomic:
//
//   1. the account withdraws its WHOLE coin to the relay's taker wallet (the arm's `withdraw_shielded`,
//      the customer's one signature). The whole coin, so no change stays behind without an inbox
//      entry (Q13);
//   2. that wallet takes the maker's offer through the batcher as an ordinary wallet taker;
//   3. it deposits what it received (the stock) and the change back into the account with
//      `deposit_shielded`, each coin with an inbox entry sealed to the account's key.
//
// If the offer is gone by step 2 — or the take does not settle — the wallet deposits the coin back
// unchanged: the REFUND. While the take is in flight the relay holds the customer's coin (custodial,
// for minutes), which is the cost of this option.
//
// This module is the orchestration only; every chain operation is an injected step, so the order,
// the amounts and every refund branch are unit-tested (relay-take.test.ts) and the gate supplies
// the real steps (gate.ts).
