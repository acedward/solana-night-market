# Night Market web app

A static Vite + React site. Every per-user record lives in the browser's local storage (see
`src/store/`); the relay keeps none. Build it with `bun run build:web` from the repository root.

## The markets (`config.json` `pairs`)

A market is any two tokens, `BASE/QUOTE`: the price is in QUOTE per BASE. The site's markets are
`config.json` `pairs` (a list of `"BASE/QUOTE"` strings), or the network's default pairs
(`NETWORK_DEFAULT_PAIRS` in `packages/core/src/tokens/pairs.ts`; stagenet: twBTC/twUSDC,
twETH/twUSDC, twUSDM/twUSDC, twETH/twBTC). No token is special in the code: a pair without twUSDC
(twETH/twBTC) is read, priced and filtered by the same code as any other. A pair that names an
unknown token, the same token twice or a token without a shielded colour is left out, with a
warning in the browser console (`Night Market: …`).

The tokens are the network's built-in list (stagenet: the vendored
[`effectstream/mint-test-tokens`](https://github.com/effectstream/mint-test-tokens) registry,
`packages/core/src/tokens/mint-test-tokens/`), plus any the site adds in `config.json` `tokens`
(`{ "tokens": [{ "symbol", "decimals", "midnightColour", "name"? }] }`; `"mode": "replace"` replaces
the list, which the local `undeployed` stack needs).

## Each site's asset set (`config.json` `assets`)

One build serves several domains. Each domain serves its own `config.json` next to `index.html`,
and its optional `assets` is that site's asset set: a list of symbols, or `"all"`.

| Site | `config.json` | Shows |
|---|---|---|
| The market domain | `{"network":"stagenet","relayUrl":"/relay"}` | every token and every default market |
| A partner domain | `{"network":"stagenet","relayUrl":"/relay","assets":["twETH","twBTC"]}` | twETH and twBTC, and their one market |
| Any site | `{"network":"stagenet","relayUrl":"/relay","assets":"all"}` | every token and market |

- Without `assets`, a site shows its network's default set: data beside the network profiles
  (`NETWORK_DEFAULT_ASSETS` in `packages/core/src/network.ts`). Stagenet's is every token (null).
- Symbols match in any case. A symbol the market does not have is ignored, with a warning in the
  browser console (`Night Market: …`). If none is known, the network's default set applies, with a
  warning: a typo never blanks the site.
- The site needs a **secure origin** (https, or `localhost` in development). The page derives and
  encrypts the account's keys with WebCrypto, which browsers only offer on a secure origin: over
  plain `http://` the page cannot open or use an account.
- Browser storage is per origin: each domain has its own accounts, records and filter. A customer
  of one domain keeps nothing on the other (Export and Import move an account between them).
- One relay serves every domain: it knows all the market's tokens.

## Showing only some assets (`?assets=`)

A link such as `https://<market>/?assets=twBTC,twUSDC` keeps that list in the browser's local data
(`night-market/v1/_global/settings/asset-filter`) and removes the parameter from the address bar;
from then on the site shows only those assets, everywhere tokens appear. The list only narrows
within the site's set: `?assets=all` goes back to the site's whole set, and a market token outside
it is named as "not available on this site" and never shown. A market shows only when both of its
assets are listed; no asset is special. Symbols match in any case; well-formed symbols the market
does not know yet stay in the list and are named in the note under the tabs, and a list with
nothing on this site shows the site's whole set. Anything waiting for the customer (a change coin
to record, a live offer) always shows. `?assets=all` or `?assets=`, **Show all assets** (under the
tabs, or in Local data) and CLEAR ALL clear it; Export and Import carry it. It only changes what
the page shows: it is not a security setting, and the relay never sees it. The code is
`src/assets/`.

## The Solana wallet (AA 00047 lane B2)

Connect lists every Solana wallet in the browser: Wallet Standard wallets that can sign Solana
messages (`solana:signMessage`), found through the standard's two window events without a
library, and Phantom's injected `window.phantom.solana` when Phantom did not register through the
standard (`src/wallet/solana-wallets.ts`). The wallet only ever signs messages, never a Solana
transaction, so it needs no SOL.

- **Every signature is checked the moment it comes back** (`src/wallet/solana-signature.ts`): with
  tweetnacl over exactly the bytes the page asked for and the connected key. One that verifies only
  over a Solana off-chain-message wrapping (`\xff"solana offchain"` ‖ …, v0, the short v0 header or
  v1, or the wallet's own `signedMessage`) is a **Ledger (hardware) account**, which v1 refuses: the
  page says "hardware (Ledger) accounts aren't supported yet" and ends the session. Any other
  mismatch is a bad signature. Neither is ever sent to the market.
- **What the wallet signs is readable text.** An account call signs Track A's F3 message (the
  circuit renders the same bytes); opening an account and claiming demo tokens sign lane B3's
  envelope, Track A's proof-of-key message. While the wallet's window is open, the page shows the
  same text and a fingerprint (the first 8 hex digits of its `Digest` or `Nonce` line)
  (`src/wallet/SigningPrompt.tsx`).
- **Errors** (`src/wallet/wallet-errors.ts`): a declined request (4001), a locked wallet (4100 /
  4900), no answer within `walletTimeoutSeconds` (config.json, default 120), a bad signature.
- **The seam** stays `src/wallet/`: `WalletContext.tsx` takes a `WalletAdapter`
  (`src/wallet/phantom-adapter.ts`), and every operation asks for signatures only through
  `ActionSigning` (`src/wallet/signing.ts`).

The browser tests use a mock Phantom (`test/e2e/mock-phantom.ts`: tweetnacl in the test process,
Phantom's byte semantics, and modes for a Ledger account, a declined request, a locked wallet, no
answer and another key) against a mock relay that checks every signature as the relay does
(`test/e2e/mock-relay.ts`).

## The Night Market design system

`src/design/` holds the market's look, taken from the owner-approved mockup: an ivory page, a deep
navy primary (`#152C55`), ONE antique-gold accent used sparingly (the masthead rule, the monogram,
the selected row, the current tracker stage, warnings), Libre Caslon Text headings, Source Sans 3
body text, tabular numerals for every amount, hairline-ruled statement tables with double-ruled
subtotals, restrained motion (none under `prefers-reduced-motion`), no gradients and no glass.

| `fonts.ts`                  | The self-hosted fonts (see below).                                                                                                                                                  |
| `index.ts`                  | Every component, imported as `from '../design/index.js'`.                                                                                                                           |

### Fonts: self-hosted, not Google Fonts

The fonts come from the `@fontsource/libre-caslon-text` and `@fontsource/source-sans-3` packages
(SIL Open Font License 1.1; the licence texts ship in `public/licenses/`) and are served from the
site's own origin. Loading them from `fonts.googleapis.com` would hand every visitor's IP address
to Google before they did anything (a German court found that to breach the GDPR, LG München I,
3 O 17493/20, 2022), while the market promises its servers keep nothing about the customer. It would
also break a strict CSP and the browser tests, which refuse any request that leaves the page's
origin. Only the Latin subset loads, with `font-display: swap`; anything else falls back to
Georgia / the system sans, and `test/e2e/visual.spec.ts` checks that fallback.

### Adopting the design system (every page uses it; follow this for anything new)

Replace plain markup with the components and keep every `data-testid` where it is: the components
pass `data-*`, `id`, `role`, `aria-*` and event props straight through to their element.

**Page frame.** A section is `<section data-testid="section-…">`, then a `PageHead`:

```tsx
<section data-testid="section-trade">
  <PageHead
    eyebrow="Make and take offers"
    title="Trade"
    lede="Every trade is one token against another. Take an existing offer now, or place your own at your price."
  />
  <div className="trade-grid">…</div>
</section>
```

Headings: the masthead's "Night Market" is the page's `h1`, a page title is an `h2` (`PageHead`), and
a panel title an `h3` (`Panel`).

**Panels.** `Panel` (white box; `title`, `meta` on the right, `tone="quiet"` for the ivory-grey
side box, `as="form"`/`"aside"`/`"div"`), `Card` (a panel with the gold top rule, for the one
card that invites an action). Two panels side by side: `<div className="form-grid">…</div>`.

**Forms.**

```tsx
<Panel as="form" title="New order" onSubmit={submit}>
  <Field label="Side">
    <Segmented label="Side" options={[{ value: 'buy', label: 'Buy' }, { value: 'sell', label: 'Sell' }]}
               value={side} onChange={setSide} />
  </Field>
  <Field label="Quantity" htmlFor="tr-qty" hint="Largest single payment: 11.00 twUSDC">
    <UnitInput id="tr-qty" unit="twBTC" inputMode="decimal" value={qty} onChange={…} data-testid="order-quantity" />
  </Field>
  <Field label="Market" htmlFor="tr-pair"><Select id="tr-pair" …>…</Select></Field>
  <div className="legs">                         {/* the exact legs, as in the mockup */}
    <div className="leg"><span className="k">You give</span><span className="v num">10.50 twUSDC</span></div>
    <div className="leg"><span className="k">You receive</span><span className="v num">0.50 twBTC</span></div>
    <div className="foot">Paid with your twUSDC coin of 11.00; the change stays in your account.</div>
  </div>
  <ButtonRow stretch>
    <Button type="submit" data-testid="place-order">Place order</Button>
    <Button variant="secondary" onClick={takeBest}>Take best ask</Button>
  </ButtonRow>
</Panel>
```

Also: `TextInput`, `CopyField` (a value to copy whole, e.g. a deposit address), `KeyValueList`
(label / value lines), `Steps` + `Step` (numbered steps the customer drives in order).

**Buttons.** `Button` with `variant` `primary` (default) / `secondary` / `danger` / `link` /
`inverse` (on the navy masthead) and `size="small"` (32 px on a desktop, 44 px on a phone or touch
screen). A link that looks like a button (the Markets book's Take): `ButtonLink href=… size="small"`.

**Money and prices.** `Money` formats exact BigInt base units with the token's decimals, grouped,
in tabular numerals, and keeps the raw value in `data-raw`:

```tsx
<Money raw={10_500_000n} decimals={6} unit="twUSDC" />   // 10.50 twUSDC
```

Prices from the book keep `bidText` / `askText` from `src/market/view.ts` (bids round down, asks
up), wrapped in `<span className="price-bid">` / `price-ask`.

**Tables.** A statement or history table stacks into label / value lines at 640 px and below;
give every non-first cell its column's `label`:

```tsx
<StatementTable caption="My offers" columns={[{ label: 'Placed' }, { label: 'Order' },
  { label: 'Quantity', align: 'right' }, { label: 'Price', sub: 'twUSDC', align: 'right' },
  { label: 'Status', align: 'right' }]}>
  {offers.map((o) => (
    <tr key={o.id} data-testid="my-offer" data-status={o.status}>
      <Cell block>{placedAt(o)}</Cell>
      <Cell label="Order">{o.side === 'sell' ? 'Sell' : 'Buy'} {o.base}</Cell>
      <Cell label="Quantity" align="right" num>{o.quantity}</Cell>
      <Cell label="Price" align="right" num>{o.price}</Cell>
      <Cell label="Status" align="right"><StatusPill status="live">Live</StatusPill></Cell>
    </tr>
  ))}
</StatementTable>
```

A value with a second line under it goes in one `<span className="num-wrap">value<Sub>second
line</Sub></span>`, so the phone layout keeps the line under the value. An order book is
`<StatementTable variant="book" …>`: it stays a compact table on a phone, with the Take button in
`<td className="act">`. A line the account cannot pay: the disabled small `Button`, in place,
wrapped in a `Tooltip` that says why on hover, keyboard focus and tap (no extra row):
`<Tooltip id="nt-…" text="Not enough twBTC. You hold 100.00 twBTC."><Button … disabled
aria-describedby="nt-…">Sell</Button></Tooltip>`. The wrapper is the focusable part, and `id` names
the visually hidden copy of the text the button's `aria-describedby` points to; the sentence
comes from `fundWithOneCoin` (`notEnoughText`). The account's own offer: `<YoursBadge />` ("Your
offer"). A holdings row: `AssetCell symbol="twBTC" name="Test-wrapped BTC" origin=…`; a subtotal:
`SubtotalRow` in `foot`.

**Badges and states.** `Badge tone="green|navy|grey|gold|red"` (a market's Two-sided / Bids only /
No liquidity), `StatusPill status="live|filled|cancelled|progress|refunded|failed|done|idle"` (an
offer's or job's state, with a dot), `NoValue` for a deliberately absent value ("no
liquidity", "not valued", "no bids"), `NetworkBadge network="midnight"`.

**Messages.** `Notice tone="info|warning|danger|success" title="…"`; give it `role="alert"` for an
error the customer caused and `role="status"` for a result. The one-live-offer rule (Q9):

```tsx
<Notice tone="warning" title="One live offer per account.">
  You already have one: Sell 0.50 twBTC at 60,000. Placing an order, taking an offer or
  withdrawing is a new signed action, and it cancels that offer. We ask you before it happens.
</Notice>
```

A confirmation before a signed action that cancels the live offer: `Dialog` (native `<dialog>`,
Escape closes it) with `actions={<><Button variant="secondary">Keep my offer</Button><Button>…</Button></>}`,
instead of `window.confirm`. A destructive action with a typed phrase: `TypedConfirmDialog` (as
Local data's CLEAR ALL). Nothing to show: `EmptyState title="…"`.

**Progress.** `StageTracker` for a long job (done stages ticked in navy, the current one ringed in
gold), and `Hash` for a transaction hash or id (shortened, with Copy, and a link when `href` is
given). Pass a stage's test attributes through `data`:

```tsx
<StageTracker label="Your take" stages={[
  { key: 'proved', title: 'Proved', state: 'done', time: '14:06',
    detail: <>Midnight tx <Hash value={txHash} /></>, data: { testid: 'trade-stage', stage: 'proved' } },
  { key: 'batcher', title: 'Sent to the exchange', state: 'current' },
  { key: 'settled', title: 'Settled', state: 'pending' },
]} />
```

**Check it.** `test/e2e/visual.spec.ts` screenshots every page at 1280 px and 375 px and asserts
no horizontal page scroll, 44 px buttons on a phone, self-hosted fonts and no gradients; add the
new page there (its fixtures are in `test/e2e/visual-fixtures.ts`). The screenshots land in
`test-results/visual/` (or `$VISUAL_OUT_DIR`).

## When something is not working (error states)

Every way the market, the exchange, the wallet or the browser can stop an action has one wording,
kept in one place and unit-tested (`test/errors.test.ts`; the walkthroughs in the browser are
`test/e2e/errors.spec.ts`):

| File | What it words |
| --- | --- |
| `src/relay/messages.ts` | The relay's refusals (rate limits with their wait, the fee wallet low or starting up, a stale or replayed signature) and failed jobs (the exchange's settlement service at its limit or failing). `RelayError.message` is already the customer's sentence. |
| `src/relay/status.ts` | What `/health` pauses: the market unreachable, its prover down, its fee wallet low or syncing (the shell); the settlement service down or refusing (Trade). `RelayStatus.tsx` reads `/health` every minute and on tab focus; pages disable what is paused and say why BEFORE the wallet is asked to sign. |
| `src/store/messages.ts` | Local storage blocked, unavailable or full. |
